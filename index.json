Although land and labor returns among Fair Trade/organic coffee growers are higher than for conventional growers, differences in yields are more important than price premiums. Moreover, investment in education and labor opportunities outside coffee dominate those in Fair Trade/organic coffee. The results highlight the value of an integrated approach to the agrarian question that improves productivity and prices and supports other pathways for improving incomes.","tags":["Latin America","Mexico","Fair Trade","organic","migration","education"],"title":"Fair Trade/Organic Coffee, Rural Livelihoods, and the “Agrarian Question”: Southern Mexican Coffee Families in Transition","type":"publication"}]
